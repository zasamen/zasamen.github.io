            <p>
                On June 6, 1936, after years of eluding the law, Lucky takes the witness stand in Supreme Court and to cross-examine him is Dewey. Lucky's defense team tries to bribe a juror, but the rest finds him guilty on 62 counts of compulsory prostitution. While Luciano is sentenced to 50 years in the remote prison in Dannemora, Dewey becomes a crime busting national hero, inspiring the radio show, Gang Busters. But Lucky figures out how to run his empire from his 8 by 10 foot cell. With the guards on his pay-roll, he enjoys outside luxuries, including fine clothing, booze, and furniture, as well as visits from his associates. Lucky must choose between Costello, the "gentleman gangster" and Genovese, the tough guy hoodlum as head of his gang. Even though, Costello is smarter, Lucky makes him an underboss and promotes Genovese to acting boss. He rules the mob with an iron fist, but let's the power go straight to his head, flaunting his wealth. Genovese can have any woman he wants, but the one he wants is his cousin Anna Petillo. In order to be together he "takes care" of her husband and they soon marry. Under Genovese's reign, the structure of Luciano's crime family collapses as he plays by his own rules, wasting money, abusing authority, and eliminating anyone who disagrees with him; all without The Commission's approval. An inmate looking to reduce his jail time confesses to a murder Genovese ordered, and he has to escape to Italy, making Costello the acting boss. With business running smoothly again, Lucky wants to expand and has Lansky plan a casino in Havana, Cuba with General Batista, while he sends Siegel to Los Angeles to take control of the Hollywood labor unions. In 1940, sentenced at Sing Sing Prison, Abe Reles begins ratting on Murder Inc. This causes Costello to order a hit on him, tracking down Reles at the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island, using his police connections to kill him. Meanwhile, Lucky is determined to get out of prison and his opportunity may come from a battle soon to be waged halfway around the world.
