            <h3> Episode 3</h3>
            <h1 class="centered">	"King of New York"</h1>
            <p>
                After taking out the two most powerful mob bosses in the city, Lucky, now 34 years old, plans to seize control of the New York Mafia. He sends out an army of hit men to eliminate old regimes and in just two days mobsters are murdered, but he saves a select few as allies. One of these men is Joe Bonanno, who's not tied to the old Sicilian ways and makes him head of his own crime family. Lucky creates an organization that won't war with each other and turns to his homeland for his inspiration. He sets up a Cosa Nostra in America with one big change—there will be on more capo di tutti capi. Instead there will be a board of directors called "The Commission", a power-sharing group made up of heads of the Five Families who will run the Mafia instead of the boss of bosses. They have the final say on all mob matters, from dividing terrorizes to ordering hits, and feuds were settled in underworld court. To carry out the mob's approved hit list, Lucky hires a notorious gang of Jewish hit men that will come to be known as Murder Inc., each with his own signature style of killing. And in just ten years, they will kill a thousand people with hundreds of murders remaining unsolved. Lucky faces his biggest threat from within; Dutch Schutz, known as the beer baron of The Bronx who isn't a part of the Five Families. When Schutz tampered with political elections, he caught the eye of assistant U.S. attorney Thomas E. Dewey. After seeing law enforcement agent Eliot Ness putting Al Capone in jail for tax evasion, he follows his lead and goes after Schutz on the same charge. With all this unwanted attention from J. Edgar Hoover and his Feds, Schutz plans to kill Dewey. But Lucky has to put a stop to the spotlight Schutz put on everything he built and organizes a hit on him. However, by taking his own man out, Lucky has put himself at the top of Dewey's most wanted list.
